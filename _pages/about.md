I'm a master's student in engineering at the University of Toronto, where I'll be working on coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics with Dr. Hamed Ibrahim. I completed my bachelor's degree in mathematics, also at the University of Toronto.

I'm currently spending this summer in the [Severe Weather and Climate Group](https://storms.physics.utoronto.ca) led by Dr. Morgan O’Neill in the Department of Physics, where I'm modelling polar vortices on giant planets and working on applications of machine learning. The use of machine learning to simulate fluid dynamics is a new and exciting area with vast applications. Learn more about my work [here](https://pnphan.github.io/work/).

I’m applying to related PhD programs this fall :D
