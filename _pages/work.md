## General

Weather forecasts are determined daily by teams across the world, using some of the world's most powerful supercomputers. Weather and climate phenomena are governed by sets of partial differential equations, whose solutions can't be determined analytically and so must be approximated computationally. This is an enormous task, requiring vast amounts of computational resources and expertise in computational fluid dynamics, numerical methods, computer science and engineering, and various areas of mathematics and physics. Yet the benefits of accurate weather prediction greatly outweigh the costs, and has many implications in our daily lives: take a moment to think about your life without an accurate weather forecast. Forecasting plays a role in effective emergency management, agriculture and energy, and even the trading of financial instruments. Many of the world's biggest companies have their own weather teams, including NVIDIA, Google, and Microsoft, as well as some of the biggest hedge funds; Citadel and Jane Street.

Machine learning has exploded in the past twenty years, and its application to weather and climate modelling is a new and exciting field of study. Weather and climate modelling generates an immense amount of data, and traditional modelling techniques are only highly accurate in the short term, or are too computationally expensive for practical use in modelling the long term. This leads to many tradeoffs that are required to engineer these models for practical use, but this means worse approximations and thus lower accuracy. Coincidentally, machine learning techniques can handle vast amounts of data at a fraction of the computational cost with greater speed, and thus hold great promise in improving the accuracy and cost of weather and climate models. There has been exciting progress in this area in the past few years.

An untapped area is the use of machine learning to improve the simulation of non-Earth weather and climate phenomena. To this end, I've been working with O'Neill's model of polar vortices on giant planets, specifically the model as it applies to Saturn, and how to apply machine learning techniques to reduce computational cost and increase accuracy.
